# Assignment 4

## Summary

This assignment is a group project to develop a web site.  It should bring together most of the topics we have covered in this class.  In the real world, web development is usually a team effort, and this last project attempts to model this situation.

## Description

You have read access to a database containing the list of students who have graduated from the UTEP CS department.  Your web site will o er public access  to  the  list  with  di erent  options  of   ltering  and  ordering.   It  will also allow CS alumni to create pro les and set whether each pro le item is accessible  to  public  or  only  other  alumni.   You  will  also  create  a  bulletin board accessible by alumni.

The web site should have the following characteristics:

1.  Consistent  look  and  feel,  where  all  pages  share  a  similar  design  and navigation scheme.  Use CSS to create some style.  We are not using packages, we are not trained as graphic artists, and time is limited, so we don't expect anything elaborate.

2.  Works on di erent browsers (test on at least 3 diffrent browsers.)

3.  It should be the group's own work.  Do not include packages or themes downloaded from the internet.  If you wish, you may use Jquery.  We did not cover it in class, but it is part of our textbook. 

The  web  site  should  have  the  following  functionality.   When  we  refer  to visitors, we mean someone who is not logged in.

1.  Allow visitors to view the list of graduates in di erent formats (by year, alphabetic, etc.)

2.  Allow  visitors  to   lter  the  list  with  di erent  criteria  (just  one  year, specific degrees, etc.)
3.  Clicking on a graduate or a button in the graduate row from the list displays the pro le of that graduate.  For visitors, only display the part of the pro le accessible to public.  For those logged in, display the whole profile.
4.  Allow graduates to log in and manage their profile.
5.  Users who are logged in should be allowed to change privacy setting on individual pro le items.  Settings include:  public, registered user.
6.  Have a page (like assignment 2) where graduates can register.  Every account should be linked to a record from the database of graduates.

For this assignment, we are not doing any verification other than that no account linked to the record already exists.

7.  Require login to access the bulletin board.
8.  Anyone logged in can add a message on the bulletin board.

__Extra credit (at most 10% extra)__

1.  Allow pictures in the pro le.
2.  Allow the author of a bulletin board message to edit or delete a posted message.
3.  Make the web site cell-phone friendly.

Instructions for what to include in your report will be communicated later.

## Due date
